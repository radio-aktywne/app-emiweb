Emission web UI ðŸŽ¤

`emiweb` is a web UI that you can use to transmit your voice over WebSockets.

To start the server make sure you have [`caddy`](https://caddyserver.com) installed, then run:

```sh
caddy run --root src
```

Then you can visit [`http://localhost:11000`](http://localhost:11000) by default in your browser and start streaming.
