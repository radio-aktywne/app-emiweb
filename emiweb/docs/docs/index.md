Emission web UI ðŸŽ¤

`emiweb` is a web UI that you can use to transmit your voice over WebRTC.

To start the server make sure you have [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com)
and [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org) installed, then run:

```sh
npm run start
```

Then you can visit [`http://localhost:13000`](http://localhost:13000) by default
in your browser and start streaming.
